  <h1> What is HTML? </h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.</p>
    <h2>Brief history</h2>
    <p>In 1990, as part of his vision of the Web, Tim Berners-Lee defined the concept of hypertext, which Berners-Lee formalized the following year through a markup mainly based on SGML. 
    The IETF began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995. 
    In 1994 Berners-Lee founded the W3C to develop the Web. 
    In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2 recommendation a year later. 
    HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and became an ISO standard in 2000.
    At that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of XHTML, prompting the founding of an independent group called WHATWG in 2004. 
    Thanks to WHATWG, work on HTML continued: the two organizations released the first draft of HTML5 in 2008 and an official standard in 2014. 
    The term "HTML5" is just a buzzword referring to modern web technologies which are part of the HTML Living Standard.

    <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. 
    It defines the meaning and structure of web content.
    Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
    "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites.
    Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, 
    you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. </p>
    <p>HTML is the markup language we use to structure content that we consume on the Web.
    HTML is served to the browser in different ways.
    It can be generated by a server-side application that builds it depending on the request or the session data, for example a Rails or Laravel or Django application.
    It can be generated by a JavaScript client-side application that generates HTML on the fly.
    In the simplest case, it can be stored in a file and served to the browser by a Web server.</p>
